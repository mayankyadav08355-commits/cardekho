<h1><font size="9" color="white"><mark>Maruti Dzire </mark>6000 Km Review: Proved Its Worth :-</font></h1>

<p><font size="6" color="white">After 4 months and many road trips, the Dzire has finally gone back, and it has left a good mark</font></p>
<p><font size="5" color="white">
There are so many cars in the <mark>Indian market</mark>, and a lot of them lie in the affordable mass market space, which try to offer the most for their price. But, I believe no car does it better than the Maruti Dzire, and I got proven right in the last 4 months, when I used it as my daily commuter and covered over 6000 km.

This car proved to be a nearly perfect commuter, and while it does have a few flaws, they’re easily overshadowed by the positives. Living with the Dzire meant living with a car that’s simple, and let me tell you, it's not a bad thing. </font></p>
